# Resonant-Breathing

Simple web app for myself to practice resonant breathing. A practice of breathing slowly, in for 5.5s, out for 5.5s for around 5.5 breaths/min.

TODO: Add customization for in and out times. For example, it'd be nice to be able to practice longer exhales like 5.5s in and 11s out.
